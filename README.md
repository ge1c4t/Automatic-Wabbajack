> ## Tips
> This application relies on looking at what's visible on your screen. With that in mind:
> 
> * The slow download button must be visible
> * It seems to require being on the primary screen
> * If you receive the error `Could not locate additional download button.` take a screenshot of the slow download button on your computer (crop it precisely) and overwrite `slow download.png` in the `img` folder. The computer vision seems to require a very precise match.
> * This program will physically move your mouse and click the button, so don't expect to be able to use the computer during the process
> 
> Cheers,
